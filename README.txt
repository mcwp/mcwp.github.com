## Stateflower using twitter bootstrap

This is a little application that I first wrote as a facebook canvas
app in python using google app engine. 

It is sort of a quiz, but one with all the answers available.  Do
youknow your state flower?  How many other state flowers do you know? 

## Original Stateflower

Uses google app engine, based on facebook canvas app example.  In
origsf. 

## pdf4gb

Python script that uses pyPdf to stitch together 152 pdf files, each
one page long, into one pdf file.  This is not a general purpose tool,
but it might serve as a nice example to copy.  It did the task I
needed done.
